# Sinatra 101

This repository is a tutorial for a first contact with the [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) gem, a [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) for quickly creating web applications in Ruby with minimal effort.

## Architecture

We coded a simple MVC architecture where the user communicated his/her intent thanks to the **router infinite loop**, `gets`-ing a number and converting it into a `Controller` method call. In the end, the view gives the information back to the user thanks to the simple `puts`.

A web app is really close to this behavior, with two minor differences. First, we use a framework (like Sinatra) to handle the router part. Here, the user expresses his/her intent with an **HTTP request**. It's up to the framework to route this HTTP request to the correct action in the `Controller`. In the end, the view is responsible to build **HTML** which is sent back to the user.

## Setup

Create a new folder to put your sinatra app in:

```bash
# replace `$GITHUB_USERNAME` with your own
mkdir ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME/cookbook-sinatra
cd ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME/cookbook-sinatra
git init  # That's a brand new repo!
```

In this directory, create a [`Gemfile`](http://bundler.io/gemfile.html) to specify which gems you'd like to use in this project:

```bash
touch Gemfile
```

Open this `Gemfile` in your text editor and copy-paste this code:

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "binding_of_caller"
gem "pry-byebug"
gem "sinatra"
gem "sinatra-contrib"
gem "thin"
```

In the terminal, run the following command to fetch the gems specified in the `Gemfile`:

```bash
bundle install
```

In your `git status`, you should see 2 files: `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock`. The `Gemfile` is where you put your project dependencies (_i.e._ which gem you want to `require` in your project), and the `Gemfile.lock` is an **auto-generated** file which specifies versions for each gem. It **locks** them actually.

Time for some checkpoint, you can commit your work:

```bash
git status
# There should be 2 files here
git add .
git commit -m "Init sinatra project"
```

Now we'll also proudly push our code to GitHub:

```bash
gh repo create --public --source=.
git push origin master
```

You can open this project in GitHub with `gh repo view --web`.

OK we're ready to write some code!

## Sinatra app

Create a file at the directory root which will be the Sinatra app main file, the entry point, the one we want to run:

```bash
touch app.rb
```

In this file, you can copy/paste this boilerplate:

```ruby
require "sinatra"
require "sinatra/reloader" if development?
require "pry-byebug"

get "/" do
  "Hello world!"
end
```

That's it. It says that for an HTTP request at the root (`/`), it will return `Hello world!`. Open a new tab in your terminal and run this:

```bash
ruby app.rb
```

You should get this output:

```bash
== Sinatra (v2.1.0) has taken the stage on 4567 for development with backup from Thin
2022-02-01 14:59:35 +0100 Thin web server (v1.8.1 codename Infinite Smoothie)
2022-02-01 14:59:35 +0100 Maximum connections set to 1024
2022-02-01 14:59:35 +0100 Listening on localhost:4567, CTRL+C to stop
```

You can see that this command **does not return**. It's running forever, like a `while` loop. And it says that a web server is running on port `4567`. That means that you can **open your browser** and go to [localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567) and see `Hello world`.

Great you made your first web server and your first HTTP request to it!

If you change the `Hello world` string with something else, save the file, go back to the browser, hit refresh, you should see your change appear. Handy!

Let me break it to you, the `app.rb` will act as the **Router** and the **Controller** of your MVC app. The routing part is the `get '/'` and the controller part is the blocks passed to the `get` (and other HTTP verbs as we'll see...) method.

```ruby
get "/" do  # <- Router part

  # [...]   #
  # [...]   # <- Controller part
  # [...]   #

end
```

Time for a commit:

```bash
git status          # What changed?
git add app.rb
git commit -m "Boilerplate sinatra app"
git push origin master
```

## Views

Technically, instead of `Hello world`, you'd want to return some **HTML**. Try returning `<h1>Hello <em>world</em>!</h1>` for instance. See?

Writing HTML directly inside the `app.rb` file is not really the way to go. That'll be for **other stuff** (controller stuff). We want to create a dedicated file for the View part of our MVC app, a file where we can play nicely with HTML.

Inside the root directory of the project, run the commands:

```bash
mkdir views
touch views/index.erb
```

Then go back your text editor in the `app.rb` file and change the root block:

```ruby
# [...]

get "/" do
  erb :index
end
```

Open the `views/index.erb` file in your text editor and paste some HTML code, for instance

```html
<p>
  I'm in a <em>view</em>!
</p>
```

OK, go back to your browser and hit refresh. Awesome :tada:, right?

## Routing

Your app is currently very small, with just one route. What if you want to add an `/about` page to your website to brag about your new web development skills?

Open the `app.rb` file in your text editor and add a new route, at the bottom of the file:

```ruby
# [...]

get "/about" do
  erb :about
end
```

You get the gist. Create a new view:

```bash
touch views/about.erb
```

And in this view you can put some more HTML:

```html
<h1>The team</h1>

<ul>
  <li>My buddy</li>
  <li>Me</li>
</ul>
```

Go back to the browser and go to [`localhost:4567/about`](http://localhost:4567/about). Awesome right?

### Other verbs

You can create routes for `POST` requests (the one the browser does when you fill in a `<form>` and hit the submit button). Works the same, see [the routing part of the doc](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html#Routes)

### Parameters

If you read on the [Routes](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html#Routes) section of the documentation, you'll see that it talks about the magic `params`. Until now in this tutorial we only dealt with static routes. What if you want a generic URL for all the people in your team? Say you want this:

```bash
/team/me
/team/my_buddy
# etc.
```

Do not write a route for every case! That's not how we code :) Instead, you see the emergence of a **parameter**. So we'll write this route:

```ruby
# [...]

get "/team/:username" do
  puts params[:username]
  "The username is #{params[:username]}"
end
```

Save your `app.rb` file and go to [`localhost:4567/team/ssaunier`](http://localhost:4567/team/ssaunier) and [`localhost:4567/team/Papillard`](http://localhost:4567/team/Papillard). See how you can pass parameters from the URL to the controller in `app.rb`?

Do not hesitate to put a `binding.pry` at the beginning of each controller block to **inspect in the terminal** what you have in `params`. **Very useful** ðŸ‘‡

```ruby
get "/team/:username" do
  binding.pry  # <= code will stop here for HTTP request localhost:4567/team/someone
  # [...]
end
```

Oh and I forgot, `params` can be filled from 3 places:

1. Routing parameters (like `/team/:username`)
1. Query string parameters (if the URL is like `/search?keyword=lewagon`)
1. Body from HTTP POST queries (coming from `<form action="post" />`)

## Passing stuff to the view

In the MVC pattern, we've seen that the controller will ask some info to the Model (with the help of a Repository handling CSV), and then ask the view to display that info. Here the controller code is inside `app.rb` and the view gets called when writing `erb :view_name`.

First of all, notice that the view file extension is `.erb`. It means **Embedded Ruby**. So you don't have to limit yourself to plain HTML in here, you can also write Ruby code and output it! For instance, try in the `views/index.erb` file:

```erb
<%= Time.now %>
```

Reload the page several time. See?

Be careful, you can use `<% %>` or `<%= %>`. The former won't output the result of your Ruby code inside the HTML. Useful for `.each` blocks:

```erb
<ul>
  <% ["Papillard", "ssaunier"].each do |username| %>
    <li>
      <%= username %>
    </li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
```

See? We just dynamically generated an HTML `<ul>` element!

OK great, but again, we're just handling static data. In the pure Ruby MVC apps (Cookbook and Food Delivery), the controller **passed some arguments to the view**. How can we do that here? Well, very simple, we'll define **instance variables** in the Controller, and they'll be automatically passed to the view :)

```ruby
# app.rb

# [...]
get "/" do
  @usernames = ["ssaunier", "Papillard"]
  erb :index
end
```

```erb
<!-- views/index.erb -->

<% @usernames.each do |username| %>
  <li>
    <%= username %>
  </li>
<% end %>
```

You see, simple: `@usernames` instance variable in the controller and you can use them in the view. Awesome :tada:!

## Layout

You can put all your views **inside** a layout, meaning they will all share some code (a navbar, a footer, etc.). Here's how you do it with Sinatra:

```bash
mkdir public
touch public/application.css
touch public/application.js
touch views/layout.erb
```

Open the `views/layout.erb` file in your text editor and copy/paste this boilerplate layout which uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

    <title>Cookbook Sinatra</title>

    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/application.css">
  </head>
  <body>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">
          <%= yield %>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-ka7Sk0Gln4gmtz2MlQnikT1wXgYsOg+OMhuP+IlRH9sENBO0LRn5q+8nbTov4+1p" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <script src="/application.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

You can notice in this boilerplate the `<%= yield %>` line. It's where your specific view will be inserted.

You can add some CSS in the `public/application.css` file and some JavaScript in the `public/application.js` one.

## Share with the world

Proud of your app? You'd like other people to see it? Well, they can't access your `localhost`! If you want to share your app with others over the Internet, we'll use the free version of [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

- If you don't have an account yet, [sign up](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup) (using GitHub for instance)
- The [Setup & Installation](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup) page should guide you.
  - If you are on macOS, simply type `brew install --cask ngrok` in your terminal
  - On Linux & Windows, download the binary and make sure to unzip it in a folder listed in your `$PATH` (ask a TA if necessary)
- Run the `ngrok config add-auth-token ...` command given to you to connect properly
- You should be ready to open HTTP tunnels :tada: !

Make sure your Sinatra app is running in a terminal window:

```bash
ruby app.rb
# or, if your `app.rb` is nested in the `lib` folder:
# ruby lib/app.rb
```

Then open a new terminal and run:

```bash
ngrok http 4567
```

Open your web browser and go to the `http(s)://???.ngrok.io` URL given by the interface. Great, you can see your app! And so can anybody on the Internet, just share this URL with your friend, on Slack, anywhere :tada: !

You can `Ctrl` + `C` the `ngrok` tab when you no longer want to share `localhost:4567` with the world, your Sinatra will still be running in the other tab and be accessible through [http://localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567).
